bio:
  - Stowed away on a cargo ship to compete in his first sumo match in Amami in 1948 at age 19.
  - Distinctive for his stature, thick eyebrows and chest hair, which were unusual for sumo wrestlers.
  - Boasted a winning record of 13-2 at an Osaka wrestling championship in 1959, breaking a longstanding jinx on wrestlers with chest hair.
  - Suffered from lumbar separation disease, which affected his later wrestling performance and hastened his retirement in 1962.
  - Resumed training in anticipation of his 60th birthday ceremony.
  - Died suddenly of a cerebral hemorrhage brought on by over drinking and the sudden strain of his new training regiment.
  - A statue in his likeness was erected at his birthplace in 1995.
